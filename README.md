# 3D-model-reconstruction-using-2D-image
Used Deep learning , torch3D , open3D libraries


## How to run it ?  


=> Create an input folder (ex. input)
=> Add your 2D image in that folder
=> Create an Output folder (ex. output)
=> Run this command in Terminal : 
      python main.py --input input/your_image.jpg --output output --visualize
=> You will get your 3D heatmap in the first window , and after closing that , you will get a 3D viewmodel . 
=> All other necesary files will be in output directory .
